<h3>Q1 What is the use of setTimeout?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The global setTimeout() method sets a timer which executes a function or specified piece of code once the timer expires.</li>
<li>The time, in milliseconds that the timer should wait before the specified function or code is executed</li>
</ul>

<pre style="color:red;font: size 15px;">
example:

setTimeout(() => {console.log("Hi, my name is ..")}, 3000);

<span style="color: black;">In this particular example, the output is printed after 3000 ms (3 seconds).</span>
</pre>

<h3>Q2 What is an event loop and call stack?</h3>
<p><b>Event loop:</b>An event loop is something that pulls stuff out of the queue and places it onto the function execution stack 
    whenever the function stack becomes empty. <br>
    It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution.
<br>Event loop gives the illusion of JavaScript being multithreaded, even though it is single threaded, meaning it runs one line at a time. </p>
<p><b>Call Stack:</b>The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed.
     Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack.
     It is like a real stack in data structures where data can be pushed and popped and follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
<br>Working Of Call stack:</p> 
<ul>
<li>When you run a JS fi;e, at the bottommost of the call stack a global execution context is created.</li>
<li>Global variables are declared inside GEC and when a function is called, a new execution context is created above GEC</li>
<li>Upon function call, the program pauses and control jumps to this context and code is executed line by line.</li>
<li>If a declared variable is not present inside the given EC, it searched for it in it's parent EC.</li>
<li>After the execution of the code in line by line mannar, the context gets erased and pops out.</li>
<li>Then the GEC also gets cleared.</li>

<h3>Q3 What are arrow functions?</h3>
<p>Arrow function is one of the features introduced in the ES6 version of JavaScript. It allows you to create functions in a cleaner way compared to regular functions. For example,:</p>
 <pre style="font-size: 15px;">
    This function:

    let x = function(x, y) {
        return x * y;
    
        // function expression
    
    let x = function(x, y) {
       return x * y;
    }

    can be written as:

    let x = (x, y) => x * y;

    // using arrow functions
    let x = (x, y) => x * y;
    using an arrow function.</pre>

<h3>Q4 What is a Temporal Dead Zone?</h3>
<p>If you are accessing any variable before it's declaration using let and const, you get an error because the variable is in temproal dead zone <br>
    <i>to avoid TDZ , try to access the variable after it's declaration and initialisation.</i>
</p>    

<h3>Q5 What is hoisting?</h3>
<pre style="font-size: 15px;">Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior in which a function or a variable can be used before declaration.
    In other words hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top. For example,

    console.log(x)
    var x=8;

    *<i>this will print the value of variable as undefined but if used another keyword like let and const we would get an error saying that we can't
        access the variable before it's initialisation.</i>

This happens as hoisting moves declarations and normal functions automatically to the top.
    </pre>
<h3>Q6 What is the DOM?</h3>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>DOM stands for Document Object Model, we can use document object in JS to do anything on the webpage.</li>
    <li>Document is the object which has complete access of the web page.</li>
    <li>Document is a big object which has different attributes and methods.</li>
    <li>HTL elements on the webpage can be accessed by using these 4 methids:</li>
    </ul><br>
<ol>
    <li>getElementById</li>
    <li>getElementsByClassName</li>
    <li>getElementsByTagName</li>
    <li>querySelector()</li>
</ol>

<h3>Q7 Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN</h3>
<table border="4px" cellspacing="2px" width="70%" style="text-align: center;">
    <tr>
    <th>undefined</th>
    <th>Not defined</th>
    <th>NaN</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Undefined in JS is a datatype.</td>
        <td>Not defined is an error.</td>
        <td>Is a number that is not a legal number.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>When a variable is declared but no specific value is assigned to it.</td>
        <td>When we try to access a variable out of it's scope</td>
        <td>Type Of NaN is number</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
