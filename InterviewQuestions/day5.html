    <h3>Q1 What is the for-in loop in JavaScript? Give its syntax</h3>
    <p>The for...in loop is used to loop through an object's properties.</p>
    <pre style="font: size 15px; color: blueviolet">

    Syntax
The syntax of 'for..in' loop is:
for (variablename in object) {
   statement or block to execute
}

    <h3>
      Q2 Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in
      javascript
    </h3>

    <b>Local Scope:</b
    ><i
      >Local scope contains things defined inside code blocks. A local variable
      has local scope. Ex= let,const</i
    ><br />
    <b>Global Scope:</b
    ><i
      >Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code
      blocks.</i
    >
    A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from
    anywhere in the code. Ex= var <br />
    <b>Functional Scope:</b
    ><i>Each function creates a new scope called function scope.</i>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Variables defined inside a function cannot be accessed from anywhere
        outside the function, because the variable is defined only in the scope
        of the function.
      </li>
      <li>
        However, a function can access all variables and functions defined
        inside the scope in which it is defined.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <b>Scope Chain:</b
    ><i
      >Scope Chain means that one variable has a scope (global or local/function
      or block scope) is used by another variable or function having another
      scope. <br />
      This complete chain formation goes on and stops when the user wishes to
      stop it according to the requirement.</i

    <h3>
      Q3 What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what?
    </h3>
    <p>
      <b>Null:</b> It is the intentional absence of the value. It is one of the
      primitive values of JavaScript. In JavaScript, null is a special value
      that represents an empty or unknown value.
      <br />
      <b>Undefined:</b> Undefined is a datatype in JS. It means the value does
      not exist in the compiler. It is the global object.
    </p>

    <h3>Q4 What is Symbol?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Symbol is a primitive data type of JavaScript</li>
      <li>
        You create a symbol by calling the Symbol() global factory function:
        const mySymbol = Symbol()
      </li>

      <li>
        Every time you invoke Symbol() we get a new and unique symbol,
        guaranteed to be different from all other symbols:
      </li>
      <li>Symbols are often used to identify object properties.</li>
      <li>
        Often to avoid name clashing between properties, since no symbol is
        equal to another. Or to add properties that the user cannot overwrite,
        intentionally or without realizing.
      </li>
      <pre style="font: size 15px; color: blueviolet">
    Example:

    const NAME = Symbol()
    const person = {
      [NAME]: 'Batman'
    }
    
    person[NAME] 
    
    const RUN = Symbol()
    person[RUN] = () => 'Batman is fighting crime'
    console.log(person[RUN]())
    
</pre
      >
    </ul>

    <h3>Q5 Write code to explain map and filter in arrays?</h3>
    <b>Map:</b>
    <p>
      map is a method built to take an array and modify every element in it.
      Example: squaring every element in an array of numbers
    </p>

    <pre style="font: size 15px; color: blueviolet">
  
    let arr = [3 , 4 , 5] 
let test = (val , index) => {
    if(val%2 == 0) {
        return val 
    }
}
let result = arr.map(test)
console.log(result, arr) 

</pre
    >

    <b>Filter:</b
    ><i
      >filter is used to remove or filter out unwanted elements from the array.
      It passes a callback to filter which gets run against every element in the
      array.
    </i>
    <p>
      If the value is true element remains in the resulting array but if the
      return value is false the element will be removed for the resulting array.
      <br />
      filter does not update the existing array it will return a new filtered
      array every time.
    </p>
    <pre style="font: size 15px; color: blueviolet">
        let result= arr.filter((val,index)=>{
            console.log(val,index)
            return (val%2!=0)
        })
        
        console.log(result);

    </pre>

    <h3>Q6 Explain passed by value and passed by reference</h3>
    <b>Passed By Value:</b> works with primitive datatype
    <ul>
      <li>
        Everytime we assign a value to a variable, a copy of that value is
        created every single time.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <b>Passed By Reference:</b>it works with non primitive datatype
    <ul>
      <li>
        when you're creating an object , you're given a reference to that
        object, if 2 objects hold the same reference, then changing the object
        reflects in both variables.
      </li>
      <li>
        In Pass by value, parameters passed as an arguments create its own copy
      </li>
      <li>
        So any changes made inside the function is made to the copied value not
        to the original value.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Q7 Please explain Self Invoking Function and its code</h3>

    <p>
      Self-invoking functions in JavaScript are the anonymous self-executing
      functions that are called after their definition. These JavaScript
      functions can run immediately when followed by the parentheses set ().
    </p>
    <b>They are also called anonymous functions.</b>
    <pre style="font: size 15px; color: blueviolet">

    (function () {
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hi! I am calling myself";
      })();

</pre
