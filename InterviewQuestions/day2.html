<h3>Q1 What is creation phase and execution phase?</h3>

    <b>Creation Phase:</b>When the JavaScript engine executes a script for the first time, it creates the global execution context.
    <ul>
    <li>During this phase, the JavaScript engine performs the following tasks:</li>
   
    <li>Create the global object i.e., window in the web browser or global in Node.js.</li>
        <li>Create the this object and bind it to the global object.</li>
        <li>Setup a memory heap for storing variables and function references.</li>
        <li> Store the function declarations in the memory heap and variables within the global execution context with the initial values as undefined.</li>
        <li>If a function is called, then the programs pauses in global execution context and control is passed to current execution phase</li>
        </ul>


    <b>Execution Phase</b>
    <ul>
    <li>During the execution phase, the JavaScript engine executes the code line by line, assigns the values to variables, and executes the function calls.</li>
    <li>For each function call, the JavaScript engine creates a new function execution context.</li>
    <li>The function execution context is similar to the global execution context. But instead of creating the global object, the JavaScript engine creates the arguments object that is a reference to all the parameters of the function:</li>
    </ul>
     
<h3>Q2 What are objects in javascript?</h3>     
<p>Objects are datastructures which hold the data in key value. It is therefore a non-primitive datatype
    <br>Objects can be created using the Object() constructor or the object initializer / literal syntax.
    <br>Objects can also have methods. Methods are stored in properties as function definitions. 
</p>

<b>Syntax:</b>
<pre>
    let user={
        name: "Gaurav ",
        email: "gauravmehra2470@gmail.com",
        age:"24"
    }
    console.log(user)
</pre>

<h3>Q3 What are function constructors?</h3>
<pre style="font-size:15px ;">
    A constructor is a special function that creates and initializes an object instance of a class.
    *In JavaScript, a constructor gets called when an object is created using the new keyword.
    *The purpose of a constructor is to create a new object and set values for any existing object properties.

Example:

function User (name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}

let user1 = new User('Gaurav', 25);
let user2 = new User('Bruce Wayne', 27);
console.log(user2)

</pre>

<h3>Q4 Explain prototypes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>All the inbuilt functions/methhods on datatype are inside prototypes.</li>
    <li>It basically defines how many methods are present inside the datatype.</li>
    <li>All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.</li>
</ul>
<pre>example:

    let obj1 = { name: 'Gaurav' }
let obj2 = new Object({name: 'Gaurav' })
console.log(obj);

</pre>

<h3>Q5 What is prototype chain</h3>
<p>Every object has a prototype, including the prototype object. This “chain” goes all the way back until it reaches an object that has no prototype, usually Object's prototype. </p>

<pre>
    example:
    const electronics= function(){};

    electronics.prototype={
        print(){
            return "These are electronics"
        }
    };

    const mobile= function(){};

    mobile.prototype= Object.create(electronics.prototype);
    mobile.prototype.print= function(){
        return " I am mobile";
    };


    const simCard= function(){};

    simCard.prototype = Object.create(mobile.prototype);
    simCard.prototype.print = function(){
        return "this is a SIM"
    };

    const sanjayElectronics= new electronics();
    const Samsung = new mobile();
    const Airtel = new simCard();

    console.log(sanjayElectronics.print());
    console.log(Samsung.print());
    console.log(Airtel.print());

If a method is not present , it will look up to it's creator in the prototype chain and find the method there.
</pre>

<h3>Q6 Give an example of inheritance using function constructor</h3>
<b>Example:</b>
<pre style="font-size: 15px ; color: red;"  >
    function Test1()
    {
        this.name="Gaurav"
        this.age="24"
    }
    let t= new Test1()
    console.log(t)
</pre>

<h3>Q7 What are callbacks?</h3>
<p>Any function that is passed as an argument to another function so that it can be executed in that other function is called as a callback function.
    <br>
    By definition, a callback is a function that you pass into another function as an argument for executing later.
</p>

example:

<pre>
    function test(a,b,c){
        a(c,b+c)
    }
    
    let x=(a,b) => {
    
    }
    
    test((a,b) => {console.log(a+b)}, 20, 40)
    
</pre>
